N 		-> Number of agents in the system 
D 		-> Lenght of the entire space (it is a square)
L		-> Number of locations in the system 
Rcmin		-> Minimum radius of the locations (they are circles)
Rcmax		-> Maximum radius of the locations (they are circles)
rmin		-> Minimum agents' radius of interaction (they are circles)
rmax		-> Maximum agents' radius of interaction (they are circles)
omega		-> exponent of the distribution of the radii of the agent's radius of interactions
gamma		-> exponent of the distribution of the radii of the radius of the locations
vexp		-> velocity outside the location
Lambda		-> infection rate
mu		-> recovery rate
perc_Infected	-> percentage of individuals infected at the beginning of the spreading 
c		-> 1/(vexp*c) corresponds to the average distance of the jump 
Steady_state	-> steps the agents move in order to reach the steady state condition
pjump		-> probability of jumping outside the location
noise		-> noise term (alpha in the paper)
delta_t		-> discrete time step (set equal to 1 in the paper)
